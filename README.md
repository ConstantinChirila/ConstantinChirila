### 👋  Hello, I am [Constantin Chirila](https://constantinchirila.com)

I currently work as a front-end engineer with UI/UX design background. I´m based in Birmingham, United Kingdom.

As a multi skilled engineer and designer, I love transforming ideas into digital products. 

I build stuff using Typescript, React (and sometimes NextJS), PostgreSQL and GoLang.
